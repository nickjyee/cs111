================================================================================

PART 1A:

make check passes all test cases.

Limitations:
Arbitrary size limit of 100 imposed on char arrays and char* arrays.

===============================================================================

PART 1B:

* Correctly executes all types of commands including:
    - Simple command
    - Simple command w/ exec
    - Simple command w/ I/O redirection 
    - Subshell commands
    - Subshell commands w/ I/O redirection 
    - Sequence
    - Pipe
    - Compound commands (if, while, until)
    - Compound commands (if, while until) w/ I/O redirection
    
Limitations:

Execution of our exec command does not prevent further processes from executing.

i.e.    

echo a
exec echo b
echo c 

Normal Shell Output:  
a
b

Our Shell Output:
a
b
c

================================================================================

PART 1C:

* Correctly prints all aspects of profiling information including:
    - real time
    - absolute time
    - user resource usage
    - system resource usage
    
Note about pipe race condition: 

Our implementation of execute_pipe_command (from PART 1B) does not allow
for there to be a race condition when writing to the log file. We
implemented execute_pipe_command in such a way that the command that executes
on the left side of the pipe must finish its execution and close the 
write end of the pipe before the right side process can exit.  This means that
our left and right sides cannot have a race condition because the left is 
always guaranteed to finish before the right and thus write to the file first.

This is a trade off.  While our implementation eliminates the possibility of 
a race condition when writing to the log file, it has the potential to 
sacrifice performance if the right side process finishes executing before
the left side finishes.  In this case the right side hangs until the left side
closes the write end of the pipe.
